## GIPHY API Project
A set of buttons display that can be clicked and GIFs of the contents of that button will appear. There is a form to type in additional items or subjects which generates new buttons. Clicking on these new buttons generates 10 GIFs of what the new content of the button is.

The API is called by a simple fetch function that loops through the results and creates divs with images in them.
