## GIPHY API Project
A set of buttons labeled with animal names can be clicked and GIFs of that animal should appear. There is a form to type in additional animals which generates new buttons. Clicking on these new buttons generates GIFs of what the new animal is. The GIFs load paused, the user should be able to pause and unpause them by clicking on them.

What this is supposed to be doing:
  Functioning.
 
What it is not doing: 
  Functioning.
